// ************attemt of phycological force**********....
All started with a calling
i try hard to ignore it
but you insisted a talking
	i know you know
we talk all the nights
for what is wrong or right
did many silly fights
	you kno  iknow
we bocome more than friends
who know each-other pain
beacase we almost same
	you know i know
on daily basis calling
no-one want the ending
even no one talking
nights comming and going.......
.....

last night, when you said
i never be more than friend
brain stuck to those phrase.
abby listen
	its heart's alot-2
i never wanted to be lover
as we discussed for hours
i don't know why it happen
i cry like a shower
abby help me
	beacase i don't know.
may be you are just thinking
we hadn't any meeting
only have nonsense talking
	but noooo..
i invested all my feeling
on those those calling and kissing
you know or you should know.
**** she just
