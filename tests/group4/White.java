Given the heights of N valleys arranged in consecutive manner and an integer M. In one step, Ninja can jump from valley i to valley
1. i + j where, i + j < number of valleys and 0 < j <= M
2. i - j where, i - j >= 0 and 0 < j <= M
Also, you are allowed to jump from valley i to valley j if height[i] > height[j] and height[i] > height[k] for valleys k between valley i and valley j. Ninja can start from any valley and start jumping. Determine the maximum number of valleys he can visit.
Note: Ninja is not allowed to jump to the right of Nth valley and left of 1st valley. (Stay within boundaries).
